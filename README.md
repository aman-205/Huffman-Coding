# Huffman Coding in Java

## Overview
This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a popular lossless data compression algorithm, in Java. The program reads input from a text file, computes the frequency of each character, builds a Huffman tree, and generates variable-length binary codes to compress the input data. It then encodes the input text using these codes.

## Features
- Takes input from a text file.
- Generates Huffman codes based on character frequency.
- Compresses the input text using the generated codes.
- Displays the Huffman codes and the encoded string.
